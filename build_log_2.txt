63:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'loadProject' and 'router'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/useCanvas.ts
60:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'canvasRef', 'options.backgroundColor', 'options.height', and 'options.width'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. Mutable values like 'canvasRef.current' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/useQRProjects.ts
20:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchProjects'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
